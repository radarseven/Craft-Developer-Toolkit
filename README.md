## Initial Setup

1. Download the zip file and unpack.
2. Bang open a shell, `cd` into the directory you've unpacked the zip to and run `bash start.sh`. This will do the following: 
    1. Run Matt's `makeItCraft` shell script. This will download Craft, follow the prompts. We also recommend that you use Matt's `DotEnv` setup and this toolkit assumes you will.
    2. Remove some unneeded files from the fresh Craft install.
    3. Move the customized files into their right place.
    4. Set permissions on files and directories.
    5. Remove the setup scripts.

## What's Different From a Stock Craft Install?

### Config

This setup supports a multi-environment config a bit differently than the native Craft config.
