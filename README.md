# Craft Developer Toolkit

A starter kit and collection of developer tools for building [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com) powered websites.

## Initial Setup

1. Download the zip file and unpack.
2. Bang open a shell, `cd` into the directory you've unpacked the zip to and run `utils start`. This will do the following: 
    1. Run Matt Stauffer's excellent `makeItCraft` shell script. The script will download Craft. Follow the prompts.
    2. Remove some unneeded files from the fresh Craft install.
    3. Move the customized files into their right place.
    4. Set permissions on files and directories.
    5. Install required composer packages.
    5. Remove the setup scripts.
